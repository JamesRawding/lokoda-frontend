        to process your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

      </ul>
      <h3>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</h3>

        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
          cannot be obtained in a timely way
        </li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>

          or may be victim of financial abuse
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
          compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
          collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
          breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
          province
        </li>
        <li>
          If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
          order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
        </li>
        <li>
          If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
          business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the
          purposes for which the information was produced
        </li>
        <li>
          If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
          purposes

        to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and
        delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided
        by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of
        his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting
        from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to
        protect against illegal activities.
      </p>
      <h4>Right to be informed â€” Request to know</h4>
      <p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
        <li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
        <li>
          the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;

      <h4>
        Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumerâ€™s Privacy
        Rights
      </h4>
      <p>
        We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy
        rights.
      </p>
      <h4>Verification process</h4>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.
      </p>
      <h4>Other privacy rights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
        <li>
          You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or
          no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can designate an authorised agent to make a request under the CCPA
          on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that
          does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on
          your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal
          information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we
